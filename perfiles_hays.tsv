I'm passionate about what I do, I love creating software from scratch and enjoy every single part of the process.

Experience
Developer, Applications, Solutions
Flextronics
January 2015 – Present (1 year 1 month)Tijuana Area, Mexico
In charge mainly of local Site development and innovation utilizing a broad scope of technologies to develop solutions for different departments/sites.

First project was to automate FAT32 - NTFS conversion by developing an application that could be executed remotely and write a log, no graphic user interface needed as the application would be executed by IT Department in background mode. The tool has now been requested by Regional/Global project administrators in order to perform that job in other Flextronics' Sites.

Responsible for innovations with Android development for Mobile Kiosk solutions in Shop Floor that interface with our ERP system.

Currently working on deploying an HMI/SCADA/MES system to enable IoT and real-time data analysis.

I've been deploying Raspberry Pi 2 for Dashboards usage using Linux, joined to our Windows Domain with auto-login for kiosk mode. Currently testing Windows 10 and Windows 10 for IoT.

June 2011 – December 2011 (7 months)
On SinTráfico.com we developed an Intelligent Traffic Information System, the first and the only of its kind in Mexico. We have also developed a web application and a mobile application available at all major mobile OS.

We also have developed a logistics cloud application designed to avoid costly delays, improve efficiency and to give a competitive advantage to the companies that manage fleets from the range of some few assets to thousands of them.

For this to happen we built an auto-scalable cloud infrastructure designed to receive millions of requests in a very short period of time, we also developed our own back-office software which allows us to understand completely the behavior of our entire system.

So, We are building the next big thing in Mexico City and beyond. http://sintrafico.com
Intern
Texas A&M University
May 2010 – March 2011 (11 months)College Station, Tx
Research Design and Development of a Matlab GUI for image processing on epithelial tissue, to pre-diagnose cancer on epithelial tissue.

The Laboratory for Optical Diagnosis and Imaging was established within the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Texas A&M University in 2007. The overall mission of our laboratory is to develop technologies that could aid to the understanding of the underlying physiology and biology in various pathological conditions, and to translate such technologies into the clinical arena.
The focus of the laboratory is to develop optical spectroscopy and imaging technologies and related signal and image processing tools for quantifying nondestructively the structure, molecular composition, and physiological state of biological tissues with both macroscopic and microscopic resolutions. Early tissue pathological transformation are accompanied by subtle changes in tissue microstructure, biochemical composition and physiological regulations. Thus, our hope is that some of our developing technologies will help to clinically detect diseases during their early stages as well as to guide, monitor and personalize clinical interventions.

""La creatividad y el aprendizaje van siempre de la mano en el proceso de mejora continua. Sin creatividad estamos condenados a repetir las cosas una y otra vez, sin la capacidad de comprenderlas, y por consecuencia, sin posibilidad de mejorarlas"" MDRP.

La experiencia que he tenido dentro del Area de TI, me ha permitido ver y ser parte, de los cambios significativos que se pueden lograr adoptando una filosofía orientada a las soluciones tecnológicas, como parte de la estrategia del cambio y automatización dentro de las empresas.

Parte fundamental del éxito alcanzado en las empresas con tendencias de innovación, será en definitiva, el entendimiento y la comprensión de la tecnología como ""aliada"" principal en cualquier proceso.

Si de inicio entendemos los fundamentos de la técnica estaremos en la posibilidad de hacer prácticas exitosas.

IT Professional with 4 years of experience in the Information Technology area. I started my career as Management Trainee in a new role created to support web innovation and then took the position of Telecom Analyst. After this position I took the responsibility for managing the IT projects portfolio for Mexico and since last October I’m leading technical IT projects for the Americas region.
During my career I’ve developed strong technical skills in:
• Project Management
• Telecommunications (WAN, LAN, Proxy, Telephony, VPN and Internet)
• Web hosting and Digital Marketing
I am considered as a very fast learner who is always taking new challenges that combine technical skills with business strategy and innovation. I’m passionate for traveling and enjoy meeting new cultures and places. I love sports specially playing tennis and running.

David Obando es un profesional de las Ciencias Computacionales egresado de la Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León de la Facultad de Ciencias Físico Matemáticas (Monterrey, México)

En el inicio de su carrera se desempeñó en el área de desarrollo de sistemas de información para compañías de calado internacional con presencia en varios países principalmente de Latinoamérica y Europa.

Obtuvo una certificación en desarrollo utilizando herramientas Microsoft lo que refino aún más su sentido de análisis y entrega de resultados satisfactorios al cliente en tiempos cada vez más cortos.

Posteriormente evoluciono a realizar tareas relacionadas a coordinación de equipos de desarrollo para la entrega de diversas soluciones principalmente en:
• Knowledge Managements
• Business Intelligence
• Finanzas
• Recursos Humanos

Su sentido de liderazgo se agudizo aún más complementando su entrenamiento con una veintena de seminarios en el Estado de Texas (USA) en un lapso de 7 años donde los temas principales fueron el liderazgo y la inteligencia emocional así como orientarse a la obtención de resultados más que realización de actividades.

Actualmente colabora en Prianti Consulting donde realiza tareas de creación de soluciones que involucran principalmente tecnologías de información y procesos de negocio. Las soluciones entregadas se centran en diversas áreas funcionales de la organización (ventas, compras, inventarios, finanzas, almacenes, etc.) siempre buscando orientarse a los procesos para lograr los resultados que la organización espera con la tecnología indicada en cada caso (Microsoft, JAVA, Oracle, SAP, etc.).

Su amplia experiencia a lo largo de su vida profesional en el tema tecnológico y de procesos lo hace poder identificar soluciones simples o complejas apoyando en el seguimiento y logro de resultados desde la cúpula de la organización (presidencia, CEO, consejo, etc.) , pasando por lo mandos gerenciales y llegando hasta la ejecución y operación de la organización.

I supported almost all the systems in the call center, from servers, network, PCs to CCTV. I had under my charge 3 persons, two of them working with the predictive dialer and one of them as my assistant. I used to travel to the different offices around the country to maintain, install and update the necessary systems. I also audited them and train people on how to use the systems.

Additionally I developed a tracking system in PHP-MySQL-Apache environment that is still in use by the company.

February 2010 – April 2013 (3 years 3 months)
Translation and Localization team is a 24/7 team, my role there was to support the global translation tool users. During my first year I supported APJ and EMEA regions, then I was promoted to the team that supports Americas.

We managed a ticketing tool in a SharePoint list, all the issues were tracked on it. Users used to have problems with MS Office, PDF, XML, HTML and other type of files, I checked and fixed them in order to get the final translated target file. I also developed some translation filters for the system (ANL files) and I started to learn and develop SharePoint hard skills, I became the SharePoint site manager."|"IT Leader
